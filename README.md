# About the APTGETME Repo
- Hi, I’m @AptGetMe, the maintainer.
- I’m interested in the QT framework written in the C++ or Python languages.
- I also do a some TypeScript, Bash, SDL framework, SFML framework and a little of everything else.

>[!NOTE] Fun with Bash. 
>My plan for the future is to fill this repository with fun (and maybe useful) bash scripts.


# CLI Weather
A command line interface weather tool (like [wthrr](https://github.com/ttytm/wthrr-the-weathercrab), or [wego](https://github.com/schachmat/wego) 
but with a view like [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)).
