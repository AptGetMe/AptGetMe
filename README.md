# About the APTGETME Repo
- Hi, I’m @AptGetMe, the maintainer.
- I’m interested in the QT framework written in the C++ or Python languages.
- I also do a some TypeScript, Bash, SDL framework, SFML framework and a little of everything else.

# Fun with Bash
My plan for the future for this repository is making fun bash scripts.
