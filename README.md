# About the APTGETME Repo
- Hi, I’m @AptGetMe, the maintainer.
- I’m interested in the QT framework apps written in both C++ or Python languages.
- I have also tried some JavaScript, Bash, SDL framework, SFML framework and a little of everything else.  

>[!NOTE]   
>My plan for the future is to fill this repository with fun (and maybe useful) bash scripts.


## Weather CLI  ⛅
A Command Line Interface **(CLI)** weather tool similar to [wthrr](https://github.com/ttytm/wthrr-the-weathercrab) or [wego](https://github.com/schachmat/wego) 
but with a view like [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch). 

Currently under development...
